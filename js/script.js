//Exercise 1
//1. Convert the following highlighted identifiers to Camel Case notation:
//   let some_month
//   function the Month()
//   let current-month
//   let summer_month
//   let MyLibrary-function
let someMonth
functionTheMonth()
let currentMonth
let summerMonth
let myLibraryFunction

//2. Give me an example of a numeric literal expression, a string literal expression, a Boolean literal expression, and a null literal expression.
let nLiteral = 6;
let sLiteral = 'Hello';
let bLiteral = true;
let nullLiteral = '';

//3. Give me two examples of complex / variable expressions.

//4. Declare (but do not assign) 9 variables for the following identifiers: 
//   First Name, Last Name, Address, City, State, Zip Code, Your Age, Referral Source, May We Contact You. 
//   Use Camel Casing and Hungarian Notation when naming your identifiers.
let strFirstName;
let strLastName;
let strAddress;
let strCity;
let strState;
let strZipCode;
let intYourAge;
let strReferralSource;
let bMayWeContactYou;

//5. Take the 3 of the 9 variables that you created above and demonstrate 3 ways for declaring and assigning values to those variables.
strFirstName = 'Molly';
intYourAge = 60;
bMayWeContactYou = True;
document.write(`Your name is ${strFirstName} `);


//6. Create a variable.
//   Add a number and a string and display the coerced result in the browser’s console window.

//7. Create two variables.
//   For the first variable, add a Boolean and a string and display the coerced result.
// For the second variable, add a number and a Boolean and display the coerced result.

//8. Is the following string literal valid? If not, how would you fix it?
//   let someString = 'Who once said, "Only two things are infinite, the universe and human stupidity, and I'm not sure about the former."'
//   console.log(someString)

//9. Create a variable that produces a null value in the console window.
//   Then, create a variable that produces an undefined value in the console window.

//10. Use the unary typeof operator on various literals to return the following types within the console window: string, number, Boolean, object, and undefined.

//11. Within an alert box, use the concatenation operator (+) to display text in the alert box that appears as follows:

//    Hello Zak Ruvalcaba, welcome to the JavaScript class!

//    Substitute my name for your name. Although not necessary in practice, I want you to use 2 concatenation operators to construct this string of text. 
//    One after the text “Hello” and a second one after your name and before the comma.

//12. Declare a variable called name and set it equal to your name.
//    Substitute your name in the previous alert string with the variable instead.
//13. Declare a variable called course and set it equal to “JavaScript”.
//    Rework your alert string so that it displays the string of text but using the variables as opposed to hard coded text.
//14. Rework the above string so that a line break is added right before the word “Welcome”. Your alert box should display as follows:
//
//    Hello Zak Ruvalcaba.
//    Welcome to the JavaScript class!

//15.Replace the hardcoded string of your name with a prompt that asks the user for their name. The prompt’s response will now be captured in the name variable.
//16.Replace the hardcoded string of the class you are taking with a prompt that asks the user for the class they are taking. The prompt’s response will now be captured in the course variable.
//17.Declare a variable called x and assign it a value of 10.
//   Declare a variable called y and assign it a value of 20.
//   Display the sum of those two numbers in the console window.
//18. Declare a variable called x and assign it a value of 20.
//   Add and assign 20 to that variable and display the result in the console window.
//   The result should be 40.
//19. Declare a variable called x and assign it a value of 20.
//   Multiply and assign 5 to that variable and display the result in the console window.
//   The result should be 100.
//20. Declare a variable called x and assign it a value that equals the remainder of 20 divided by 3.
//    Divide and assign 1 to that variable and display the result in the console window.
//    The result should be 2. If you got 6.66 try again.
//21. Using a set of Comparison and Logical operators, write an application that evaluates to true and displays the result within the console window.
//22. Using a set of Comparison and Logical operators, write an application that evaluates to false and displays the result within the console window. The application cannot use the same 
//    operators used in the previous application.
